## cat

The `cat` command is ideal for displaying small files: `cat filename_or_filepath`  
Use the `-n` option to display line numbers: `cat -n filename`  

`cat` can also be used to con**cat**enate files: `cat filename1 filename2 > output_file`  

### Redirection

Use `>` to redirect the output of a command to the specified file.  
It will create the file if not existing, or will overwrite the contents of the file if already existing.  

Use `>>` to append the result (add it at the end) instead of overwriting any pre-existing content.

## less (is more ðŸ˜€)

If the output of a text file exceeds the terminal window, it's best to use `less` or `more` instead of `cat`.  
Both tools are known as "pagers", they take the input from a file and send it to the terminal one page at a time.  

`less` extends the capabilities of `more` and is probably the most advanced reading tool that Linux provides.  
The syntax is `less filename`  
To exit the file reading, type **q**.

`less` is what is used when we display man pages.

While in the file, you can use the arrow keys to move one line up or down.  
To forward one page, press **Ctrl + F**, and **Ctrl + B** to move one page backward.  
To go to the beginning of a file, press lowercase **g**, and uppercase **G** to go to the very end.  

To search the current file for a specific string:
- move at the beginning by pressing **g**
- type a forward slash **/** followed by the string you're looking for
- then navigate between matches with **n** (next occurrence) or **N** (previous occurrence)

## tail, head, watch

Using `tail`, you can view the last lines of a file, by default it shows the last 10 lines.  
Of course, `head` does the same but shows the first lines of a file.  

You can specify the desired number of lines: `tail -n 16 filename` or `tail -16 filename` 

To track modifications in a file: `tail -f /var/log/auth.log`  
When done tracking changes to the file, press Ctrl + C.  

### watch

The `watch` command in Linux is a utility that repeatedly runs a specified command at regular time intervals, 
displaying its output in real time on the terminal.  

Itâ€™s especially useful for monitoring system statistics, observing directory contents, or tracking changes in files and processes without manually re-running commands.  

By default, it re-runs the command every 2 seconds, and you can stop it anytime by pressing `Ctrl + C`.  
To re-run the command every x seconds: `watch -n x <command>`  
To highlight changes between successive command outputs, use the `-d` option.
