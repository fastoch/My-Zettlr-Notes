# The Basics

## Accessing SharePoint online

- Go to https://www.office.com/ and sign in 
- Once logged in, click on the **"App Launcher"** at the top left of your screen
- click on SharePoint

Note that Microsoft Office is now called Microsoft 365 since 2020.  

Microsoft 365 includes:
- Outlook
- Teams
- OneDrive
- SharePoint
- The online versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint

There's also online exclusives that not many users know about:
- Microsoft Forms: to build polls, surveys, and quizzes
- Microsoft Stream: to record video content, share it, and publish it across the organization
- PowerBI: to upload your reports, semantic models, and create dashboards

SharePoint doesn't have a desktop application.  

## Team site vs Communication site

Some organizations won't allow you to create sites.  
But if you're allowed to create sites, you must choose between these 2 types.  

### Team site

Create a team site to provide a location where you and your team can work on projects and 
share information from anywhere on any device.  

A team site includes: 
- a group of related web pages,
- a default document library for files,
- lists for data management,
- and web parts that you can customize to meet your needs

A team site is ideal for collaborative work.

### Communication site

If your intention is to simply broadcast information to a large audience, a communication site is the better choice.  
It can be seen as an intranet for your company.  
It's usually used to share news, reports, status, and other info in a visually compelling format. 

### Deleting a site

You must be one of the site owners to do that. Regular members can't delete a site.  
Click the gear icon at the top right and select "site information", then click on "delete site".

## Accessing Site Contents

The gear icon at the top right allows us to access the current site contents. 

### Label + sub links

If our navigation menu gets cluttered, we can create a label and move some links under this label:
- enter edit mode in the navigation menu
- hover between 2 links from the navigation menu
- click the + sign and select "label"
- name your label
- move the label to the top of your navigation menu (or wherever you want it)
- click the 3 dots next to the links you want to put under the new label
-
